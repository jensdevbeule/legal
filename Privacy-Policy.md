### Your privacy is critically important to us. At Pressable, we have a few fundamental principles:

#### We don’t ask you for personal information unless we truly need it (we can’t stand services that ask you for things like your gender or income level for no apparent reason).

#### We don’t share your personal information with anyone except to comply with the law, develop our products, or protect our rights.

#### We don’t store personal information on our servers unless required for the on-going operation of one of our services.

#### In the product offered, we aim to make it as simple as possible for you to control what’s visible to the public, seen by search engines, kept private, and permanently deleted.

### Below is our privacy policy which incorporates these goals. If you have questions about deleting or correcting your personal data please contact our [Help Desk](https://help.pressable.com/).

# Privacy Policy

Pressable Inc. (“Pressable”) operates several websites including, but not limited to, [Pressable.com](https://pressable.com), [mystagingwebsite.com](mystagingwebsite.com), and [openhostingservice.com](openhostingservice.com). It is Pressable’s policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect while operating our websites.

## Website Visitors

Like most website operators, Pressable collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. Pressable’s purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how Pressable’s visitors use its website. From time to time, Pressable may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.

Pressable also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for logged in users and for users leaving comments on sites hosted by Pressable. Pressable only discloses information about logged-in users and commenters under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information as described in our [Legal Guidelines](https://pressable.com/legal/legal-guidelines/), except that site commenter IP addresses are visible and disclosed to the administrators of the site where the comment was left.

## Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information

Certain visitors to Pressable’s websites choose to interact with Pressable in ways that require Pressable to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that Pressable gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who sign up for Wordpress hosting services at Pressable.com to provide a name and email address. Those who engage in transactions with Pressable are asked to provide additional information, including as necessary the personal and financial information required to process those transactions. In each case, Pressable collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor’s interaction with Pressable. Pressable does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described in our [Legal Guidelines](https://pressable.com/legal/legal-guidelines/). And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities.

## Aggregated Statistics

Pressable may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to its websites. For instance, Pressable may monitor the most popular sites or use spam screened by the Akismet service to help identify spam. Pressable may display this information publicly or provide it to others. However, Pressable does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described in our [Legal Guidelines](https://pressable.com/legal/legal-guidelines/).

## Cookies

A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor’s computer, and that the visitor’s browser provides to the website each time the visitor returns. Pressable uses cookies to help Pressable identify and track visitors, their usage of Pressable website, and their website access preferences. Pressable visitors who do not wish to have cookies placed on their computers should set their browsers to refuse cookies before using Pressable’s websites, with the drawback that certain features of Pressable’s websites may not function properly without the aid of cookies.

## Business Transfers

If Pressable, or substantially all of its assets were acquired, or in the unlikely event that Pressable goes out of business or enters bankruptcy, user information would be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any acquirer of Pressable may continue to use your personal information as set forth in this policy.

## Ads

Ads appearing on any of our websites may be delivered to users by advertising partners, who may set cookies. These cookies allow the ad server to recognize your computer each time they send you an online advertisement to compile information about you or others who use your computer. This information allows ad networks to, among other things, deliver targeted advertisements that they believe will be of most interest to you. This Privacy Policy covers the use of cookies by Pressable and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers.

## Comments

Comments and other content submitted to the Akismet anti-spam service are not saved on our servers unless they were marked as false positives, in which case we store them long enough to use them to improve the service to avoid future false positives.

## Privacy Policy Changes

Although most changes are likely to be minor, Pressable may change its Privacy Policy from time to time, and in Pressable’s sole discretion. Pressable encourages visitors to frequently check this page for any changes to its Privacy Policy. Your continued use of this site after any change in this Privacy Policy will constitute your acceptance of such change.
